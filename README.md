## Hey there!
My name is Amanda, and I'm from Washington! I'm pivoting from accounting to chase my dream as a UI Developer. I completed my UX Design studies through Designlab and recently completed my web development bootcamp through Skillspire! 

Currently, I'm a Developer Apprentice at Tech Fleet to get more hands on experience with SCSS and React in an agile environment. <br /><br />
