## Hey there!
My name is Amanda, and I'm from Washington! I'm pivoting from accounting to chase my dream as a UI Developer. I completed my UX Design studies through Designlab and recently completed my web development bootcamp through Skillspire! 

Recently laid off at a local design/marketing agency, so I'm looking for work! <br /><br />
